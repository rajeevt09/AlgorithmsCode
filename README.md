# Algorithms and Data Structures
Code for commonly Used Algorithms And Coding Problems . The examples are
implemented in C++ and they demonstrate using C++ Std library Containers and 
functions from std Library & Algorithms.

The Organization of this project is as below :

1. LinkedLists - demonstrated examples for using LinkedLists , Stacks , Arrays , Heaps and other common data structures
2. Recursion   - common problems using recursion approach to solve. eg : Palindromic Decomposition, N Queens, SubSets
3. Sorting     - sorting algorithms and problems eg: 3sum , partitioning , quick select.
4. Trees       - Tree Traversals, Binary Search Trees(Predecessor,Successor),Inorder Tree Iterator.
5. Graphs      - Depth First,Breadth First, Topological Sort, Grids, Longest Distance in DAG, Cycle Detection.
6. Dynamic programming -  Edit Distance , Word Break, Coin Change, LCS, LIS , Text Editing. 
7. Strings     - Substring search ,Min Window Substring , Tries , Regular Expression Matcher. 
8. AdHoc problems - Intervals, Histogram, LRU Cache, LFU Cache.
